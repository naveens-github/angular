# Angular notes
* What is the equivalent of pom.xml in Angular, and where do we put all the dependencies?
    > In Angular, the equivalent file to pom.xml is package.json. All the dependencies for the Angular project, including runtime dependencies (dependencies) and development dependencies (devDependencies), are listed in this file.

* How do we install dependencies in an Angular project?
    > 1. We need to ensure Node.js is installed: node -v, npm -v.
    > 2. Run the command to install dependencies: npm install
    > 3. The dependencies will be downloaded into a folder named node_modules. 

* Data is present in the components in typescript files. 
* HTML Files are views
* CSS Files are for Styles
